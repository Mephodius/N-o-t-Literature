//Some interesting Jaba facts ive researched

Jaba vs C++
1. #GENERAL No destructors, no pointers, all the classes are inherated from the Object.
2. #METHODS Object arguments are transmitted with the help of links, and the primitive ones with creating of local copy.
3. #INHERITANCE All the methods in classes are already virtual.
4. #GENERAL Existanse of wrapper-classes.
